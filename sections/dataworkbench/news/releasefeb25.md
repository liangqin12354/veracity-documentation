# February 2025  release
Read this page to learn what has changed in Veracity Data Workbench with the release in February 2025.

## New features
This section covers new features.

### Improved UI scaling for smaller screens
We have improved scaling in the UI for smaller screens to make it easier to use Data Workbench on devices with screen size below 1280 pixels.

### Workspace details page
We have added a page with workspace details. To find it, open the Workspace page and then select the **Details** tab.

On this tab, you can see the following:
* Workspace name
* Region
* Workspace description

If you are a workspace admin, you can also edit this information. However, you cannot change workspace's region.


### Add or edit workspace description
Now, workspace admins can add workspace descriptions when creating or editing a workspace. They can use this description to provide helpful information on the workspace; for example, what kind of data sets are shared inside it, who's using it, and for what.

As a workspace admin, to edit workspace description, go to Workspace > Details and, on the **Workspace details** tile, select the editing icon.

### See user's tenant access level
Now, in Workspace > Members, you can see user's tenant access level and workspace access level. If your role allows it, you can also change user's access level.

See [details on user access level](../usermanagement.md).

### Data set schema information
You can now view the schema description for each dataset in the datasets list. This provides additional context and understanding of the data within the dataset. The `schemaDescription` field is now included in the response of the `/workspaces/{workspaceId}/datasets/query` endpoint.

### Get workspace details via API
You can now retrieve detailed information about a workspace calling the following endpoint `/tenants/{tenantIdOrAlias}/workspaces/{workspaceId}`. This API returns the workspace ID, name, description, and region.

### Update workspace details via API
You can now update the name and description of a workspace calling the following endpoint `/tenants/{tenantIdOrAlias}/workspaces/{workspaceId}`.

## Changes in existing features

### Updated text in the tick box allowing resharing
We have updated the text in the tick box that you can select when sharing a data set, file, or folder. If you select it, it allows the recipient to share the data set, file, or folder with other people.
